# Kubernetes Learning Project (Ku8_project)

This repository documents my learning journey with Kubernetes (K8s). Each folder contains resources, notes, and examples related to specific Kubernetes concepts or setups. Below is an overview of the folders and their contents.

## Folder Structure and Descriptions

### Setu_minikube
This folder contains resources and notes on setting up and configuring **Minikube**, a tool for running a single-node Kubernetes cluster locally. It includes:
- Installation steps for Minikube.
- Configuration details for starting and managing a Minikube cluster.
- Examples of deploying simple applications on Minikube.

### k8s-pod-networking
This folder focuses on **Kubernetes pod networking**. It covers:
- Concepts of pod-to-pod communication and networking models in Kubernetes.
- Examples of configuring network policies.
- Notes on Kubernetes networking components like CNI plugins and service discovery.

### ku8_nodes
This folder is dedicated to understanding **Kubernetes nodes**. It includes:
- Information on node components (e.g., kubelet, container runtime).
- Notes on node management and troubleshooting.
- Examples of scaling nodes or configuring node resources.

### ku8_pod
This folder explores **Kubernetes pods**, the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. It contains:
- Examples of pod definitions and configurations.
- Notes on pod lifecycle, multi-container pods, and init containers.
- Experiments with pod creation and management.

### ku8_resources
This folder covers **Kubernetes resources** and their management. It includes:
- Notes on resource types like CPU and memory limits/requests.
- Examples of defining resource quotas and limit ranges.
- Best practices for optimizing resource usage in Kubernetes clusters.

## Getting Started
To explore the contents, navigate to each folder for detailed notes, scripts, and examples. Most folders include YAML files, scripts, or documentation specific to the topic. Feel free to use these resources to follow along or adapt them for your own Kubernetes learning.
